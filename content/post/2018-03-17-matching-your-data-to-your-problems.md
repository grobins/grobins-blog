## The Analytics Lifecycle


For the last 15yrs I've been explaining data to people.  Most of the time it's pretty easy, you look at the latest sales report and describe trends or outliers to the management team, but sometimes you get a request that isn't covered by the 'standard reporting'.   I considered my main job to be a gardener to the 'standard reporting suite' that was agreed to at some management meeting years earlier.  But each week I would set aside some time for these 'adhoc' requests.  They were annoying, poorly thought out, and usually involved a huge amount of work in order to answer a problem that wasn't really important to the person asking it.
